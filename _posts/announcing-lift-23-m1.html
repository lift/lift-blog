      <div class="Unindented">The <a href="http://liftweb.net/" class="URL">Lift</a> team is pleased to announce <a href="http://liftweb.net/download.html" class="URL">Lift 2.3-M1</a>.<br /> </div> <br /> Lift is an elegant, expressive framework that allows any size team build and maintain secure, highly interactive, scalable web applications quickly and efficiently. Lift is built on <a href="http://scala-lang.org" class="URL">Scala</a> and compiles to JVM byte-code. Lift applications deploy as web archives (WAR files) on popular application servers and web containers including Jetty, Glassfish and Tomcat. Lift applications can be monitored and managed with the same proven infrastructure used to manage and monitor any Java web application. Lift is open source licensed under an Apache 2.0 license.<p />  This is the first milestone for 2.3 series and suports Scala 2.8.0 and 2.8.1. See the <a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/milestones/321049">ticket tracker</a> for full list of new features, enhancements and bug fixes.<p />  Thank you, have fun!<br /> - The Lift team
