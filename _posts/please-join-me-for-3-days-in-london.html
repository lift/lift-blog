I&#39;m doing a <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/course-details/437">three day course</a> September 14-16 at Skills Matter in London.<p />The first day of the course will be the standard <a href="http://simply.liftweb.net"><i>Simply Lift</i> </a>stuff... basically it&#39;s getting started with Lift.<p /> The next two days, though, I hope will be magic.  The idea of spending a couple of days face-to-face, hands-to-keyboard with a small number of people is very exciting to me.<p />One of the greatest joys for me is to work with people as they learn Lift and see how they approach problem solving.  While the Lift mailing list is a great place to watch how people approach Lift, there&#39;s no substitute for doing it face to face with the high bandwidth communications channel called reality.<p /> I am looking forward to working with a small group of people to learn what challenges they face building web apps and how they can use Lift as it stands today to make that process easier.  But more importantly, how we can improve Lift to meet the challenges of our end users.<p /> So, if you<a href="https://skillsmatter.com/course-details/437"> join me</a>, you will learn Lift, get lots of one-on-one time with me, and I promise to add features to Lift in real time to make your web app building easier and better.<p /> I am really looking forward to it!
