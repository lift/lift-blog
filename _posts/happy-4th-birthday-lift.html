Happy 4th Birthday Lift! <p /><div>Four years ago, we started the Lift project.  Back then I was a Scala newbie, yet I had a vision that developing secure web apps should be simple, that developing interactive web apps should be simple, and that the compiler is your friend.</div> <p /><div>Four years later and 2 major releases and many milestone releases later, Lift holds true to the original vision.</div><p /><div>Four years later, the Lift community is more than 2,500 people strong, there are hundreds of Lift apps in production and some pretty high profile sites are successfully using Lift.</div> <p /><div>For me, personally, I&#39;m really glad that the Lift community is so awesome... full of people who are willing to help others and give the kind of feedback that helps Lift grow and expand.  I&#39;m also really impressed by the Lift committers... nearly 50 people scattered across the world who contribute time, code, and personal attention to Lift and the Lift community.</div> <p /><div>So, on Lift&#39;s fourth birthday, I want to say thanks to the Lift community and the Lift committers for building something tremendous: Lift.</div>
