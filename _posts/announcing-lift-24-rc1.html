<p>The Lift team is excited to announce the <a href="http://liftweb.net/download">availability</a>&nbsp;of Lift 2.4-RC1. <p /> Bug fixes since Lift 2.4-M5 are listed <a href="http://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/milestones/387136">here</a>.<p /> We are getting real close now. All going well, this would be the last RC before Lift 2.4 final. If your project depends on 2.4, test things out and report your observation to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/liftweb">mailing list</a>. <p /> Enjoy coding with Lift. <p /> Thank you, Merry Christmas! <br />- The Lift Team</p>
