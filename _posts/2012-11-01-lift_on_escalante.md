## Escalante and OpenShift is a super-simple way to deploy Lift apps ##

The [RedHat](http://redhat.com) [OpenShift](http://escalante.io/news/2012/10/28/lift-on-openshift/) folks
are making it super-simple to deploy a Lift app.

The [Escalante](http://escalante.io/) project provides an amazingly simple way to deploy a [Lift](http://liftweb.net) app.

Basically, just write you Lift app with a Maven POM file, git-push the app to OpenShift and in a few minutes,
you app is live.

## How to do it ##

I built a simple [Lift/Escalante app](http://frog-bearfeeder.rhcloud.com/).

Basically, I followed the [instructions](http://escalante.io/news/2012/10/28/lift-on-openshift/) and
then I added the code for a [simple chat app](http://simply.liftweb.net/index-Chapter-2.html#toc-Chapter-2).

OpenShift and Escalante just work with Lift. Thanks for [Galder](htp://twitter.com/galderz) for creating
Escalante and lowering to barriers to entry for Lift.
