Part of my ongoing commitment to Lift&#39;s growth and the success of Lift users and the Lift community, I will be doing &quot;office hours&quot; a couple of Mondays a month. <p /><div>Office hours are an open invitation for anybody to drop by my office (541 8th Street in San Francisco) with Lift questions, suggestions, project demos or just to chat.</div><p /><div>The first Lift Office Hours are from 11am PST to 3pm PST on Monday January 30th.</div> <p /><div>So, if you&#39;re in the Bay Area and want to chat, come on by. Â There&#39;s plenty of coffee, tea, and other beverages.</div><p /><div>Looking forward to meeting folks!</div><p /><div> Thanks!</div><p /><div>David</div>
