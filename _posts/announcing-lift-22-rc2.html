      <div class="Unindented">The <a href="http://liftweb.net/" class="URL">Lift</a> team is pleased to announce <a href="http://liftweb.net/download.html" class="URL">Lift 2.2-RC2</a>.</div> <div class="Indented"><br /> Lift is an elegant, expressive framework that allows any size team build and maintain secure, highly interactive, scalable web applications quickly and efficiently. Lift is built on <a href="http://scala-lang.org" class="URL">Scala</a> and compiles to JVM byte-code. Lift applications deploy as web archives (WAR files) on popular application servers and web containers including Jetty, Glassfish and Tomcat. Lift applications can be monitored and managed with the same proven infrastructure used to manage and monitor any Java web application. Lift is open source licensed under an Apache 2.0 license.<p />  This is the second release candidate in the 2.2-RC* series following up on <a href="http://lift.la/lift-22-rc1">Lift 2.2-RC1</a> released last week. Since then, the team has closed <a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/milestones/277365">13 tickets</a>.<p />  Lift 2.2 would support all of Scala 2.7.7, 2.8.0 and 2.8.1. This would also be the last version to support Scala 2.7.7, the future version would be for Scala 2.8+ only (see <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/liftweb/browse_thread/thread/f07322a798d9f497">post</a>).<p />  <div class="Unindented"> Please join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/liftweb">Lift community</a> and help us grow Lift. And a super-big thanks to the 30+ <a href="http://liftweb.net/team">Lift committers</a> who have grown the Lift community and code-base to what it is today... and what it will be in the future! &nbsp;</div> <p /> <div class="Unindented">We expect to ship Lift 2.2 release on January 5th. All going well, this is probably going to be the last RC before final release. Please test these 2.2-RC* series and help us <a href="http://ticket.liftweb.net/">identify bugs</a> so we can make Lift 2.2 awesome!</div> <br /> Thank you, have fun as always!<br /> - The Lift team<p />  </div>
