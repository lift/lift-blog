Marketing is hard.  Creating concise messages is super hard.  Having 3 seconds to explain to someone why your product is better and then losing their attention is the way things work.<p />I&#39;ve spent a lot of time working out why Lift is better than any other web framework.  I&#39;ve boiled the list down to <a href="http://seventhings.liftweb.net">Seven Things</a>:<br /> <ol><li>Lazy Loading</li><li>Parallel page rendering</li><li>Comet and Ajax</li><li>Wiring -- declare interdepencies between page elements</li><li>Designer friendly templates</li><li>Wizard -- multipage input screens with full back-button support</li> <li>Security</li></ol>Each of the above taken in isolation is something that Lift does that few other web frameworks do (e.g., you can use JBoss Seam instead of Lift&#39;s Wizard) and Lift does each one better than any other web framework.  But taken together, they tell a compelling story about why Lift is different.<p /> I&#39;ve put together <a href="http://seventhings.liftweb.net">http://seventhings.liftweb.net</a> as a way to not only list the Seven Things, but also to give code examples.  Even if you&#39;re not a Scala coder, you will be able to see the concise, elegant way that each of the seven things is expressed in Lift.<p /> And as Lift becomes a polyglot framework, as Lift supports JRuby and Java and other languages, there will still be <a href="http://seventhings.liftweb.net">Seven Things</a> that differentiate Lift from all other web frameworks.
