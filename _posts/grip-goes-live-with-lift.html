<a href="http://www.grabgrip.com/">Grip</a> is live with their systems built on the Lift web framework.Â  Grip is a financial decision support tool that enables financial institutions of all sizes to brand and offer an app that provides the most sought after mobile services. It aggregates consumers&#39; balance and transaction data from unlimited number of domestic financial institutions into a single, up-to-the-minute collective view, empowering them to understand their money flow simply and without clutter. With no core integration, no set-up fee, no annual fee and no minimum user agreement, Grip simply cost the financial institution .99 cents per active user, per month.<p /> It&#39;s very exciting to see more companies basing their business on Lift... especially companies from Iowa.
