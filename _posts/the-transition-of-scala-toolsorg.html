It&#39;s been a little slow in coming (those ship dates always slip), but the <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/people/2012/02/scala-artifacts-now-on-central/">Sonatype</a> folks will be taking over the hosting of Scala related artifacts from <a href="http://scala-tools.org">scala-tools.org</a>. <p /><div>Currently, Sonatype is rsyncing the entire <a href="http://scala-tools.org">scala-tools.org</a> repository so that anything published to <a href="http://scala-tools.org">scala-tools.org</a> will be mirrored up to Sonatype.</div> <p /><div>We have transferred the LDAP information for all the <a href="http://scala-tools.org">scala-tools.org</a> such that you will be able to publish directly to Sontaype&#39;s servers.</div><p /><div> In the next week or so, we will be pointing the DNS for <a href="http://nexus.scala-tools.org">nexus.scala-tools.org</a> and other domains over to Sonatype&#39;s servers such that existing projects will be communicating directly with Sonatype&#39;s servers (we were hoping to do that before the announcement, but, well... things happen.)  We will also be 301-ing all incoming requests for artifacts to Sonatype&#39;s servers so that existing projects with existing configuration files will be getting the latest and greatest from Sonatype&#39;s servers.</div> <p /><div>Between now and mid-June, <a href="http://scala-tools.org">scala-tools.org</a> will point to Sonatype&#39;s servers.  Once the redirects are in place and periodically thereafter, I will be making reminder posts to point configuration files to Sonatype&#39;s servers.  I will also send out periodic emails to the folks who have been publishing to <a href="http://scala-tools.org">scala-tools.org</a> to update their configuration files to point to Sonatype&#39;s servers and to remind their communities to update configuration files to Sonatype&#39;s servers.</div> <p /><div>In mid-June, <a href="http://scala-tools.org">scala-tools.org</a> will no longer redirect to Sonatype&#39;s servers.</div><p /><div>I&#39;d like to thank the Sonatype folks for being so helpful about transitioning the repository from <a href="http://scala-tools.org">scala-tools.org</a> to the Sonatype servers.  I&#39;d also like the thank Derek who came up for air and helped out with the LDAP stuff.</div> <p /><div>More information and technical specifics as they become available.</div>
