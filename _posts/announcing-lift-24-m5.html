<p>The Lift team is excited to announce the <a href="http://liftweb.net/download">availability</a>&nbsp;of Lift 2.4-M5 (Milestone 5). <p /> Quite a few <a href="http://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/milestones/525891">enhancements and bug fixes</a>&nbsp;have been added since Lift 2.4-M4 for this release. <p /> Lift 2.4-M5 would be the last milestone before 2.4 final release. If your project depends on 2.4, now is the time to test things even more rigorously. <p /> And, as usual, join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/liftweb">Lift community</a> and enjoy coding with Lift. <p /> Thank you, have fun! <br />- The Lift Team <p /></p>
