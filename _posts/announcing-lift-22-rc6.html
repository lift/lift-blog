      <div class="Unindented">The <a href="http://liftweb.net/" class="URL">Lift</a> team is pleased to announce <a href="http://liftweb.net/download.html" class="URL">Lift 2.2-RC6</a> with <a href="https://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/milestones/332851">one tickets</a> closed since the previous release candidate.</div> <br /> This is the sixth release candidate in the 2.2-RC* series.<p />  All going well, this would possibly be the last RC before the final Lift 2.2 ships. Unless community testing reveals any serious bug that gets <a href="http://ticket.liftweb.net/">identified</a>, that is.<br /> Looking forward to an awesome Lift 2.2 final later this week!<p />  Thank you, have fun, look forward to a great 2011!<br /> - The Lift team
